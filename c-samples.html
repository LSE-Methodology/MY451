<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>So far we have discussed statistical description, which is concerned with summarizing features of a sample of observed data. From now on, most of the attention will be on statistical inference. As noted in Section <a href="c-intro.html#ss-intro-def-descr">1.2.3</a>, the purpose of inference is to draw conclusions about the characteristics of some larger population based on what is observed in a sample. In this chapter we will first give more careful definitions of the concepts of populations and samples, and of the connections between them. In Section <a href="#s-samples-popdistrs"><strong>??</strong></a> we then consider the idea of a population distribution, which is the target of statistical inference. The discussion of statistical inference will continue in Chapters @ref(c-tables}–. One of the results illustrated by it is that if <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span> is the true value of of the population probability <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\pi-\pi_{0}=0\)</span>, there is a probability of 0.95 that for a randomly drawn sample from the population the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test statistic <span class="math inline">\(z=\hat{\Delta}/\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}\)</span> is between <span class="math inline">\(-1.96\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(+1.96\)</span>. This also implies that the probability is 0.95 that in such a sample the observed value of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Delta}\)</span> will be between <span class="math inline">\(\Delta-1.96\,\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta+1.96\,\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}\)</span>. Furthermore, it is clear from the figure that all of the values within this interval are more likely to occur than any of the values outside the interval (i.e. those in the two tails of the sampling distribution). The interval thus seems like a sensible summary of the “most likely” values that the estimate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Delta}\)</span> may have in random samples.</p>
A confidence interval essentially turns this around, into a statement about the unknown true value of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> in the population, even in cases where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is not 0. This is done by substituting <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Delta}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> above, to create the interval
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\text{from  }
\hat{\Delta} -1.96\times \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}
\text{  to  }
\hat{\Delta}
+1.96\times \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}.
\label{eq:cim0}\end{equation}\]</span>
This is the <strong>95 % confidence interval</strong> for the population difference <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>. It is usually written more concisely as
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\hat{\Delta}
\pm 1.96\, \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}
\label{eq:cim1}\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where the “plusminus” symbol <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> indicates that we calculate the two endpoints of the interval as in (\ref{eq:cim0}), one below and one above <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Delta}\)</span>.</p>
Expression (\ref{eq:cim1}) is general in the sense that many different quantities can take the role of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> in it. Here we consider for now the case of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\pi-\pi_{0}\)</span>. The estimated standard error <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}\)</span> is analogous to (\ref{eq:seDhatp}) used for the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test, but not the same. This is because the confidence interval is not calculated under the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}:\; \pi=\pi_{0}\)</span>, so we cannot use <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in the standard error. Instead, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is estimated by the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}\)</span>, giving the estimated standard error
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}} = \sqrt{
\frac{\hat{\pi}(1-\hat{\pi})}{n}
}
\label{eq:sephat2}\end{equation}\]</span>
and thus the 95% confidence interval <span class="math display">\[(\hat{\pi}-\pi_{0}) \pm 1.96 \;
\sqrt{
\frac{\hat{\pi}(1-\hat{\pi})}{n}}\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\pi-\pi_{0}\)</span>. Alternatively, a confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> itself is given by
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\hat{\pi} \pm 1.96 \;
\sqrt{
\frac{\hat{\pi}(1-\hat{\pi})}{n}}.
\label{eq:cip2}\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>This is typically the most useful interval for use in practice. For instance, in the referendum example 5.1 this gives a 95% confidence interval of <span class="math display">\[0.470\pm 1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{0.470\times(1-0.470)}{702}}
=0.470\pm 0.0369=(0.433, 0.507)\]</span> for the proportion of definite Yes-voters in the population. Similarly, in Example 5.2 the 95% confidence interval for the probability of a black person being selected for the jury pool is (0.040, 0.052). These intervals are also shown in Table <a href="#tab:t-probex"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<div id="s-probs-1sampleci-int" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Interpretation of confidence intervals</h3>
<p>As with the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value of a significance test, the precise interpretation of a confidence interval refers to probabilities calculated from a sampling distribution, i.e. probabilities evaluated from a hypothetical exercise of repeated sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we obtained many samples from the population and calculated the confidence interval for each such sample using the formula (\ref{eq:cip2}), approximately 95% of these intervals would contain the true value of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is undeniably convoluted, even more so than the precise interpretation of a <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value. In practise a confidence interval would not usually be described in exactly these words. Instead, a research report might, for example, write that (in the referendum example) “the 95 % confidence interval for the proportion of eligible voters in the population who definitely intend to vote Yes is (0.433, 0.507)”, or that “we are 95 % confident that the proportion of eligible voters in the population who definitely intend to vote Yes is between 43.3% and 50.7%”. Such a statement in effect assumes that the readers will be familiar enough with the idea of confidence intervals to understand the claim. It is nevertheless useful to be aware of the more careful interpretation of a confidence interval, if only to avoid misunderstandings. The most common error is to claim that “there is a 95% probability that the proportion in the population is between 0.433 and 0.507”. Although the difference to the interpretation given above may seem small, the latter statement is not really true, or strictly speaking even meaningful, in the statistical framework considered here.</p>
In place of the 1.96 in (\ref{eq:cim1}), we may also use other numbers. To allow for this in the notation, we can also write
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\hat{\Delta} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\; \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}.
\label{eq:ci-D-gen}\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where the multiplier <span class="math inline">\(z_{\alpha/2}\)</span> is a number which depends on two things. One of them is the sampling distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Delta}\)</span>, which is here assumed to be the normal distribution (another possibility is discussed in Section <a href="#ss-means-inference-variants"><strong>??</strong></a>). The second is the <strong>confidence level</strong> which we have chosen for the confidence interval. For example, the probability of 0.95 in the interpretation of a 95% confidence interval discussed above is the confidence level of that interval.

<p>A confidence interval contains, loosely speaking, those numbers which are considered plausible values for the unknown population difference <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> in the light of the evidence in the data. The <em>width</em> of the interval thus reflects our uncertainty about the exact value of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, which in turn is related to the amount of information the data provide about <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>. If the interval is wide, many values are consistent with the observed data, so there is still a large amount of uncertainty; if the interval is narrow, we have much information about <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> and thus little uncertainty. Another way of stating this is that when the confidence interval is narrow, estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> are very <em>precise</em>.</p>
<p>The width of the interval (\ref{eq:ci-D-gen}) is <span class="math inline">\(2\times z_{\alpha/2}\times \hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}\)</span>. This depends on</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The confidence level: the higher the level, the wider the interval. Thus a 99% confidence interval is always wider than a 95% interval for the same data, and wider still than a 90% interval. This is logically inevitable: if we want to state with high level of confidence that a parameter is within a certain interval, we must allow the interval to contain a wide range of values. It also explains why we do not consider a 100% confidence interval: this would contain all possible values of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> and exclude none, making no use of the data at all. Instead, we aim for a high but not perfect level of confidence, obtaining an interval which contains some but not all possible values, for the price of a small chance of incorrect conclusions.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard error <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}\)</span>, which in the case of a single proportion is (\ref{eq:sephat2}). This in turn depends on</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>: the larger this is, the narrower the interval. Increasing the sample size thus results (other things being equal) in reduced uncertainty and higher precision.</p></li>
<li><p>the true population proportion <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>: the closer this is to 0.5, the wider the interval. Unlike the sample size, this determinant of the estimation uncertainty is not in our control.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Opinion polls of the kind illustrated by the referendum example are probably where non-academic audiences are most likely to encounter confidence intervals, although not under that label. Media reports of such polls typically include a <em>margin of error</em> for the results. For example, in the referendum example it might be reported that 47% of the respondents said that they would definitely vote Yes, and that “the study has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points”. In most cases the phrase “margin of error” refers to a 95% confidence interval. Unless otherwise mentioned, we can thus take a statement like the one above to mean that the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of interest is approximately <span class="math inline">\(47\pm 4\)</span> percentage points. For a realistic interpretation of the implications of the results, the width of this interval is at least as important as the point estimate of the proportion. This is often neglected in media reports of opinion polls, where the point estimate tends to be headline news, while the margin of error is typically mentioned only in passing or omitted altogether.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Confidence intervals vs. significance tests</h3>
<p>There are some obvious similarities between the conclusions from significance tests and confidence intervals. For example, a <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test in the referendum example 5.1 showed that the null hypothesis that the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> was 0.5 was not rejected (<span class="math inline">\(P=0.112\)</span>). Thus 0.5 is a plausible value for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in light of the observed data. The 95% confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> showed that, at this level of confidence, plausible values for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> are those between 0.433 and 0.507. In particular, these include 0.5, so the confidence interval also indicates that a proportion of 0.5 is plausible. This connection between the test and the confidence interval is in fact exact:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}: \Delta=0\)</span> about a population quantity <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is rejected at the 5% level of significance using the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-test against a <em>two-sided</em> alternative hypothesis, the 95 % confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> will not contain 0, and vice versa. Similarly, if <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}\)</span> is not rejected, the confidence interval will contain 0, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same is true for other matching pairs of levels of significance and confidence, e.g. for a test with a 1% level of significance and a 99% (i.e. (100-1)%) confidence interval. In short, the significance test and the confidence interval will in these cases always give the same answer about whether or not a parameter value is plausible (consistent with the data) at a given level of significance/confidence.</p>
<p>These pairs of a test and an interval are exactly comparable in that they concern the same population parameter, estimate all parameters in the same way, use the same sampling distribution for inference, and use the same level of significance/confidence. Not all tests and confidence intervals have exact pairs in this way. Also, some tests are for hypotheses about more than one parameter at once, so there is no corresponding single confidence interval. Nevertheless, the connection stated above is useful for understanding the ideas of both tests and confidence intervals.</p>
<p>These results also illustrate how confidence intervals are inherently more informative than significance tests. For instance, in the jury example 5.2, both the test and the confidence interval agree on the implausibility of the claim that the population probability of being selected to the jury panel is the same as the proportion (0.124) of black people in the population, since the claim that <span class="math inline">\(\pi=0.124\)</span> is rejected by the test (with <span class="math inline">\(P&lt;0.001\)</span>) and outside the interval <span class="math inline">\((0.040; 0.052)\)</span>. Unlike the test, however, the confidence interval summarizes the plausibility of <em>all</em> possible values of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and not just <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}=0.124\)</span>. One way to describe this is to consider what would have happened if we had carried out a series of significance tests of null hypotheses of the form <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}: \pi=\pi_{0}\)</span> for a range of values of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span>. The confidence interval contains all those values <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span> which would not have been rejected by the test, while all the values outside the interval would have been rejected. Here <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}: \pi=\pi_{0}\)</span> would thus not have been rejected at the 5% level if <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{0}\)</span> had been between 0.040 and 0.052, and rejected otherwise. This, of course, is not how significance tests are actually conducted, but it provides a useful additional interpretation of confidence intervals.</p>
<p>A confidence interval is particularly useful when the parameter of interest is measured in familiar units, such as the proportions considered so far. We may then try to judge, in substantive terms, how wide the interval is and how far it is from particular values of interest. In the jury example the 95% confidence interval ranges from 4.0% to 5.2%, which suggests that the population probability is estimated fairly precisely by this survey. The interval also reveals that even its upper bound is less than half of the figure of 12.4% which would correspond to proportional representation of blacks in the jury pool, a result which suggests quite substantial underrepresentation in the pool.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Inference for comparing two proportions</h2>
<p>In Examples 5.3 and 5.4, the aim is to compare the proportion of a dichotomous response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> between two groups of a dichotomous explanatory variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example 5.3: compare the proportion of polio cases among the unvaccinated (<span class="math inline">\(\pi_{1}\)</span>) and vaccinated (<span class="math inline">\(\pi_{2}\)</span>) children.</p></li>
<li><p>Example 5.4: compare the proportion of optimistic responses to a negative (<span class="math inline">\(\pi_{1}\)</span>) vs. positive wording of the question (<span class="math inline">\(\pi_{2}\)</span>).</p></li>
</ul>
The quantity of interest is then the population difference
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\Delta=\pi_{2}-\pi_{1}.
\label{eq:Dp2sample}\end{equation}\]</span>
For a significance test of this, the null hypothesis will again be <span class="math inline">\(H_{0}:\; \Delta=0\)</span>, which is in this case equivalent to the hypothesis of equal proportions
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}H_{0}:\; \pi_{1} = \pi_{2}.
\label{eq:H0pD}\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>The null hypothesis thus claims that there is no association between the group variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the dichotomous response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, while the alternative hypothesis (e.g.  the two-sided one <span class="math inline">\(H_{a}:\; \pi_{1}\ne \pi_{2}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(H_{a}:\; \Delta\ne 0\)</span>) implies that there is an association.</p>
The obvious estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{2}\)</span> are the corresponding sample proportions <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}_{2}\)</span>, calculated from samples of sizes <span class="math inline">\(n_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{2}\)</span> respectively, and the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is then
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\hat{\Delta}=\hat{\pi}_{2} - \hat{\pi}_{1}.
\label{eq:Dhatpi}\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>This gives <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Delta}=0.000284-0.000706=-0.000422\)</span> in Example 5.3 and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Delta}=0.364-0.279=0.085\)</span> in Example 5.4. In the samples, the proportion of polio cases is thus lower in the vaccinated group, and the proportion of optimistic answers is higher in response to a positively worded question. Note also that although the inference discussed below focuses on the difference of the proportions, for purely descriptive purposes we might prefer to use some other statistic, such as the ratio of the proportions. For example, the difference of 0.000422 in polio incidence between vaccine and control groups may seem small, because the proportions in both groups are small. A better idea of the the magnitude of the contrast is given by their ratio of <span class="math inline">\(0.000706/0.000284=2.49\)</span> (this is known as the <em>risk ratio</em>). In other words, the rate of polio infection in the unvaccinated group was two and a half times the rate in the vaccinated group.</p>
<p> The tests and confidence intervals discussed below are again based on the assumption that the relevant sampling distributions are approximately normal, which is true when the sample sizes <span class="math inline">\(n_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{2}\)</span> are large enough. The conditions for this are not very demanding: one rule of thumb states that the methods described in this section are reasonably valid if in both groups the number of observations with <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> having the value 1, and of ones with the value 0, are both more than 5. This condition is satisfied in both of the examples considered here.</p>
<p>The validity of the test, as well as the amount of information the data provide about <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{2}\)</span> in general, thus depends not just on the overall sample sizes but on having enough observations of both values of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. The critical quantity is then the number of observations in the rarer category of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In Example 5.3 this means the numbers of children diagnosed with polio, because the probability of polio was low in the study population. The numbers of eventual polio cases were 142 and 57 in the control and treatment groups respectively, so the rule of thumb stated above was satisfied. With such low probabilities of polio incidence, sufficient numbers of cases were achieved only by making the overall sample sizes <span class="math inline">\(n_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{2}\)</span> large enough. That is why the trial had to be very large, involving hundreds of thousands of participants.</p>
The standard error of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Delta}\)</span> is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\sigma_{\hat{\Delta}} =
\sqrt{
\frac{\pi_{2}(1-\pi_{2})}{n_{2}}
+\frac{\pi_{1}(1-\pi_{1})}{n_{1}}
}.
\label{eq:sigmaDpi}\end{equation}\]</span>
As in the one-sample case above, the best way to estimate this is different for a significance test than for a confidence interval. For a test, the standard error can be estimated under assumption that the null hypothesis (\ref{eq:H0pD}) is true, in which case the population proportion is the same in both groups. A good estimate of this common proportion, denoted below by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\pi}\)</span>, is the proportion of observations with value 1 for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in the total sample of <span class="math inline">\(n_{1}+n_{2}\)</span> observations, pooling observations from both groups together; expressed in terms of the group-specific estimates, this is
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\hat{\pi} = \frac{n_{1}\hat{\pi}_{1}+n_{2}\hat{\pi}_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}.
\label{eq:phat2sample}\end{equation}\]</span>
Using this for both <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{2}\)</span> in (\ref{eq:sigmaDpi}) gives the estimated standard error
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}=
\sqrt{
\hat{\pi}(1-\hat{\pi}) \; \left(
\frac{1}{n_{2}}+
\frac{1}{n_{1}}
\right),
}
\label{eq:seDpi}\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>and using (@ref(eq:Dhatpi}) and ()–()–()–() and ( and  and ) from (\ref{eq:mu2)) leaves us with <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{3}\)</span>. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{3}\)</span> is the change in expected value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_{3}\)</span> is increased by one unit, while keeping the values of <span class="math inline">\(X_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_{2}\)</span> unchanged. The same result would obviously be obtained for <span class="math inline">\(X_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_{2}\)</span>, and for models with any number of explanatory variables. Thus in general</p>
<ul>
<li>The regression coefficient of any explanatory variable in a multiple linear regression model shows the change in expected value of the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> when that explanatory variable is increased by one unit, while holding all other explanatory variables constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is only one explanatory variable, the “while holding…” part is omitted and the interpretation becomes the one for simple linear regression in Section <a href="#ss-regression-simple-int"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This interpretation of the regression coefficients is obtained by “increasing by one unit” and “holding constant” values of explanatory variables by mathematical manipulations alone. It is thus true within the model even when the values of the explanatory variables are not and cannot actually be controlled and set at different values by the researcher. This, however, also implies that this appealing interpretation is a mathematical construction which does not automatically correspond to reality. In short, the interpretation of the regression coefficients is always mathematically true, but whether it is also an approximately correct description of an association in the real world depends on the appropriateness of the model for the data and study at hand. In some studies it is indeed possible to manipulate at least some explanatory variables, and corresponding regression models can then help to draw reasonably strong conclusions about associations between variables. Useful results can also be obtained in studies where no variables are in our control (so-called <em>observational studies</em>), as long as the model is selected carefully. This requires, in particular, that a linear model specification is adequate for the data, and that no crucially important explanatory variables have been omitted from the model.</p>
<p>In the IMR example, the estimated coefficients in Table <a href="#tab:t-imr-m2"><strong>??</strong></a> are interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Holding levels of Control of corruption and Income inequality constant, increasing School enrolment by one percentage point decreases expected IMR by 0.139 percentage points.</p></li>
<li><p>Holding levels of School enrolment and Income inequality constant, increasing Control of corruption by one unit decreases expected IMR by 0.046 percentage points.</p></li>
<li><p>Holding levels of School enrolment and Control of corruption constant, increasing Income inequality by one unit increases expected IMR by 0.055 percentage points.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of “holding constant”, we often talk about “controlling for” other variables in such statements. As before, it may be more convenient to express the interpretations in terms of other increments than one unit (e.g. ten units of the measure of Income inequality) by multiplying the coefficient by the correponding value.</p>
<p>The association between the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and a particular explanatory variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> described by the coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in a multiple regression model is known as a <strong>partial association</strong> between <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, controlling for the other explanatory variables in the model. This will often differ from the association estimated from a simple regression model for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, because of the correlations between the control variables and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. In the infant mortality example, the estimated effect of School enrolment was qualitatively unaffected by controlling for the other variables, and decreased in magnitude from -0.179 to -0.139.</p>
<div id="inference" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Inference</h4>
Inference for the regression coefficients in a multiple linear model differs from that for the simple model in interpretation but not in execution. Let <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_{j}\)</span> denote the estimated coefficient of an explanatory variable <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> may be any of <span class="math inline">\(1,2,\dots,k\)</span>), and let <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\text{se}}(\hat{\beta}_{j})\)</span> denote its estimated standard error. The standard errors cannot now be calculated by hand, but they are routinely produced by computer packages and displayed as in Table <a href="#tab:t-imr-m2"><strong>??</strong></a>. A <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test statistic for the null hypothesis discussed below is given by
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}t=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{j}}{\hat{\text{se}}(\hat{\beta}_{j})}.
\label{eq:tbeta-m}\end{equation}\]</span>
This is identical in form to statistic (\ref{eq:tbeta}) for the simple regression model. The corresponding null hypotheses are, however, subtly but crucially different in the two cases. In a multiple model, (\ref{eq:tbeta-m}) is a test statistic for the null hypothesis
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}H_{0}:\; \beta_{j}=0, \text{other regression coefficients
are unrestricted}
\label{eq:H0beta-m}\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>against the alternative hypothesis <span class="math display">\[H_{a}:\; \beta_{j}\ne0, \text{other regression coefficients
are unrestricted}.\]</span> Here the statement about “unrestricted” other parameters implies that neither hypothesis makes any claims about the values of other coefficients than <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{j}\)</span>, and these are allowed to have any values. The null hypothesis is a claim about the association between <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> when the other explanatory variables are already included in the model. In other words, (\ref{eq:tbeta-m}) tests <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
H_{0}:&amp; &amp; \text{There is no partial association between }
X_{j} \text{ and } Y,\\
&amp;&amp;  \text{controlling for the other explanatory
variables.}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The sampling distribution of (\ref{eq:tbeta-m}) when the null hypothesis (\ref{eq:H0beta-m}) holds is a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution with <span class="math inline">\(n-(k+1)\)</span> degrees of freedom, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is again the number of explanatory variables in the model. The test statistic and its <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value from the <span class="math inline">\(t_{n-(k+1)}\)</span> distribution are shown in standard computer output, in a form similar to Table <a href="#tab:t-imr-m2"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note two things about test results for multiple regression models, such as those in Table <a href="#tab:t-imr-m2"><strong>??</strong></a>. First, (\ref{eq:H0beta-m}) implies that if the null hypothesis is not rejected, <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span> is not associated with <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, <em>if</em> the other explanatory variables are already included in the model. We would typically react to this by removing <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span> from the model, while keeping the other variables in it. This is because of a general principle that models should usually be as simple (<em>parsimonious</em>) as possible, and not include variables which have no partial effect on the response variable. Second, the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> tests and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-values actually refer to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> <em>different</em> hypotheses of the form (\ref{eq:H0beta-m}), one for each explanatory variable. This raises the question of what to do if, say, tests for two variables have large <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-values, suggesting that either of them could be removed from the model. The appropriate reaction is to remove one of the variables (perhaps the one with the larger <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value) rather than both at once, and then see whether the other still remains nonsignificant (if so, it can then also be removed). This is part of the general area of <strong>model selection</strong>, principles and practice of which are mostly beyond the scope of this course; some further comments on it are given in Section <a href="c-samples.html#s-regression-rest">3.4</a>.</p>
<p>In the example shown in Table <a href="#tab:t-imr-m2"><strong>??</strong></a>, the <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-values are small for the tests for all of the coefficients. Each of the three explanatory variables thus has a significant effect on the response even after controlling for the other two, so none of the variables should be removed from the model.</p>
A confidence interval with confidence level <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{j}\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\hat{\beta}_{j} \pm t_{\alpha/2}^{(n-(k+1))} \,
\hat{\text{se}}(\hat{\beta}_{j}).
\label{eq:cibeta-m}\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>This is identical in form and interpretation to the interval (\ref{eq:cibeta}) for simple regression (except that the degrees of freedom are now <span class="math inline">\(df=n-(k+1)\)</span>), so no new issues arise. The confidence intervals for the coefficients in our example (where <span class="math inline">\(df=n-4=107\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_{0.025}^{(107)}=1.98\)</span>) are shown in Table <a href="#tab:t-imr-m2"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Including categorical explanatory variables</h2>
<div id="ss-regression-dummies-def" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Dummy variables</h3>
<p>Our models for Infant mortality rate so far did not include some more basic characteristics of the countries than school enrolment, corruption and income inequality. In particular, it seems desirable to control for the wealth of a country, which is likely to be correlated with both a health outcome like infant mortality and the other measures of development used as explanatory variables. We will do this by adding to the model the income level of the country, classified in the Global Civil Society Yearbook into three groups as Low, Middle or High income. Here one reason for considering income as a categorical variable is obviously to obtain an illustrative example for this section. However, using a variable like income in a grouped form is also more generally common practice. It also has the advantage that it is one way of dealing with cases where the effects on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> of the corresponding continuous explanatory variable may be nonlinear.</p>
<p>Summary statistics in Table <a href="#tab:t-imrvars"><strong>??</strong></a> show that income group is associated with both IMR and the explanatory variables considered so far: countries with higher income tend to have lower levels of infant mortality, and higher school enrolment, less corruption and less income inequality than lower-income countries. It thus seems that controlling for income is potentially necessary, and may change the conclusions from the model.</p>
<p>Trying to add income level to the model confronts us with a new problem: how can a categorical explanatory variable like this be used in linear regression? This question is not limited to the current example, but is unavoidable in the social sciences. Even just the standard background variables such as sex, marital status, education level, party preference, employment status and region of residence considered in most individual-level studies are mostly categorical. Similarly, most survey data on attitudes and behaviour are collected in a categorical form, and even variables such as age or income which are originally continuous are often used in a grouped form. Categorical variables are thus ubiquitous in the social sciences, and it is essential to be able to use them also in regression models. How this is done is explained in this section, again illustrated with the infant mortality example. Section <a href="c-samples.html#ss-regression-dummies-example">3.3.2</a> then describes a different example for further illustration of the techniques.</p>
<p>The key to handling categorical explanatory variables is the use of dummy variables. A <strong>dummy variable</strong> (or <strong>indicator variable</strong>) is a variable with only two values, 0 and 1. Its value is 1 if a unit is in a particular category of a categorical variable, and 0 if it is not in that category. For example, we can define for each country the variable <span class="math display">\[D_{m}=\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if Income level is ``Middle&#39;&#39;} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\]</span> This would typically be referred to as something like “dummy for middle income level”. Note that the label <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}\)</span> used here has no special significance, and was chosen simply to make it easy to remember. Dummy variables will be treated below as regular explanatory variables, and we could denote them as <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>s just like all the others. A dummy for high income level is defined similarly as <span class="math display">\[D_{h}=\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if Income level is ``High&#39;&#39;} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}\]</span> The two variables <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_{h}\)</span> are enough to identify the income level of any country. If a country is in the middle-income group, the two dummies have the values <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_{h}=0\)</span> (as no country can be in two groups), and if it has high income, the dummies are <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_{h}=1\)</span>. For low-income countries, both <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_{h}=0\)</span>. There is thus no need to define a dummy for low income, because this category is identified by the two other dummies being both zero. The same is true in general: if a categorical variable has <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> categories, only <span class="math inline">\(K-1\)</span> dummy variables are needed to identify the category of every unit. Note, in particular, that <em>dichotomous</em> variables with only two categories (<span class="math inline">\(K=2\)</span>) are fully identified by just one dummy variable. The category which is not given a dummy of its own is known as the <strong>reference category</strong> or <strong>baseline category</strong>. Any category can be the baseline, and this is usually chosen in a way to make interpretation (discussed below) convenient. The results of the model will be the same, whichever baseline is used.</p>
<p>Categorical variables are used as explanatory variables in regression models by including the dummy variables for them in the model. The results for this in our example are shown in Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-imr-m3">3.2</a>. This requires no changes in the definition or estimation of the model, and the parameter estimates, standard errors and quantities for statistical inference are obtained exactly as before even when some of the explanatory variables are dummy variables. The only aspect which requires some further explanation is the interpretation of the coefficients of the dummy variables.</p>

<p>Recall that the regression coefficient of a continuous explanatory variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the expected change in the response variable when <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is increased by one unit, holding all other explanatory variables constant. Exactly the same interpretation works for dummy variables, except that it is limited to the only one-unit increase possible for them, i.e. from 0 to 1. For example, consider two (hypothetical) countries with values 0 and 1 for the dummy <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}\)</span> for middle income, but with the same values for the three continuous explanatory variables. How about the other dummy variable <span class="math inline">\(D_{h}\)</span>, for high income? The interpretation requires that this too is held constant in the comparison. If this constant value was 1, it would not be possible for <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}\)</span> to be 1 because every country is in only one income group. Thus the only value at which <span class="math inline">\(D_{h}\)</span> can be held constant while <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}\)</span> is changed is 0, so that the comparison will be between a country with <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}=1, \, D_{h}=0\)</span> and one with <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}=0,\, D_{h}=0\)</span>, both with the same values of the other explanatory variables. In other words, the interpretation of the coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}\)</span> refers to a comparison in expected value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> between a middle-income country and a country in the baseline category of low income, controlling for the other explanatory variables. The same applies to the coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(D_{h}\)</span>, and of dummy variables in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>The coefficient of a dummy variable for a particular level of a categorical explanatory variable is interpreted as the <em>difference</em> in the expected value of the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> between a unit with that level of the categorical variable and a unit in the baseline category, holding all other explanatory variables constant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here the estimated coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(D_{m}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(-3.21\)</span>. In other words, comparing a middle-income country and a low-income country, both with the same levels of School enrolment, Control of corruption and Income inequality, the expected IMR is 3.21 percentage points lower in the middle-income country than in the low-income one. Similarly, a high-income country has an expected IMR 3.296 percentage points lower than a low-income one, other things being equal. The expected difference between the two non-reference levels is obtained as the difference of their coefficients (or by making one of them the reference level, as discussed below); here <span class="math inline">\(-3.296-(-3.210)=-0.086\)</span>, so a high-income country has an expected IMR 0.086 percentage points lower than a middle-income one, controlling for the other explanatory variables.</p>
<p>Predicted values are again obtained by substituting values for the explanatory variables, including appropriate zeros and ones for the dummy variables, into the estimated regression equation. For example, the predicted IMR for a country with School enrolment of 86 %, Control of corruption score of 50 and Income inequality of 40 is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\hat{Y}&amp;=&amp;12.0-0.091\times 86-0.020\times 50+0.080\times 40-3.210\times
0-3.296\times 0\\
&amp;=&amp;
6.37 \text{for a low-income country, and }\\
\hat{Y}&amp;=&amp;12.0-0.091\times 86-0.020\times 50+0.080\times 40-3.210\times
1-3.296\times 0\\
&amp;=&amp;
6.37-3.21=3.16 \text{for a middle-income country,}\end{aligned}\]</span> with a difference of 3.21, as expected. Note how the constant term 12.0 sets the level for the baseline (low-income) group, and the coefficient <span class="math inline">\(-3.21\)</span> shows the change from that level when considering a middle-income country instead. Note also that we should again avoid unrealistic combinations of the variables in such predictions. For example, the above values would not be appropriate for high-income countries, because there are no such countries in these data with Control of corruption as low as 50.</p>
<p>The choice of the reference category does not affect the fitted model, and exactly the same results are obtained with any choice. For example, if high income is used as the reference category instead, the coefficients of the three continuous variables are unchanged from Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-imr-m3">3.2</a>, and the coefficients of the dummy variables for low and middle incomes are 3.296 and 0.086 respectively. The conclusions from these are the same as above: controlling for the other explanatory variables, the difference in expected IMR is 3.296 between low and high-income, 0.086 between middle and high-income and <span class="math inline">\(3.296-0.086=3.210\)</span> between low and middle-income countries. Because the choice is arbitrary, the baseline level should be selected in whichever way is most convenient for stating the interpretation. If the categorical variable is ordinal (as it is here), it makes most sense for the baseline to be the first or last category. In other ways the dummy-variable treatment makes no distinction between nominal and ordinal categorical variables. Both are treated effectively as nominal in fitting the model, and information on any ordering of the categories is ignored.</p>
<p>Significance tests and confidence intervals are obtained for coefficients of dummy variables exactly as for any regression coefficients. Since the coefficient is in this case interpreted as an expected difference between a level of a categorical variable and the reference level, the null hypothesis of a zero coefficient is the hypothesis that there is no such difference. For example, Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-imr-m3">3.2</a> shows that the coefficients of both the middle income and high income dummies are clearly significantly different from zero. This shows that, controlling for the other explanatory variables, expected infant mortality for both middle and high-income countries is different from that in low-income countries. The 95% confidence intervals in Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-imr-m3">3.2</a> are intervals for this difference.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the coefficients of the two higher groups are very similar, which suggests that they may not be different from each other. This can be confirmed by fitting the same model with high income as the reference level, including dummies for low and middle groups. In this model (not shown here), the coefficient of the middle income dummy corresponds to the difference of the Middle and High groups. Its <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value is 0.907 and 95% confidence interval <span class="math inline">\((-1.37; 1.54)\)</span>, so the difference is clearly not significant. This suggests that we could simplify the model further by combining the two higher groups and considering only two income groups, low vs. middle/high.</p>
<p>In cases like this where a categorical explanatory variable has more than two categories, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests of individual coefficients are tests of hypotheses about no differences between individual categories, not the hypothesis that the variable has no effect overall. This is the hypothesis that the coefficients of the dummies for <em>all</em> of the categories are zero. This requires a slightly different test, which will not be considered here. In our example the low income category is so obviously different from the other two that it is clear that the hypothesis of no overall income effect would be rejected.</p>
<p>The main reason for including income group in the example was not to study income effects themselves (it is after all not all that surprising that infant mortality is highest in poor countries), but to control for them when examining partial associations between IMR and the other explanatory variables. These describe the estimated effects of these continuous variables when comparing countries with similar income levels. Comparing the results in Tables <a href="#tab:t-imr-m2"><strong>??</strong></a> and <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-imr-m3">3.2</a>, it can be seen that the effect of School enrolment remains significant and negative (with higher enrolment associated with lower mortality), although its magnitude decreases somewhat after controlling for income group. Some but not all of its estimated effect in the first model is thus explained away by the fact that income is associated with both primary school enrolment and infant mortality, with richer countries having both higher enrolment and lower mortality.</p>
<p>The effect of Income inequality also remains significant in the larger model, even with a slightly increased coefficient. Countries with larger income inequality tend to have higher levels of infant mortality, even when we compare countries with similar levels of income. The effect of Control of corruption, on the other hand, is no longer significant in Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-imr-m3">3.2</a>. This variable is strongly associated with income (as seen in Table <a href="#tab:t-imrvars"><strong>??</strong></a>), with the more corrupt countries typically being poor. Controlling for income, however, level of corruption appears to have little further effect on infant mortality. This also suggests that we might simplify the model by omitting the corruption variable.</p>
<p>One final remark on dummy variables establishes a connection to the techniques discussed in Chapter <a href="#c-means"><strong>??</strong></a>. There we described statistical inference for comparisons of the population means of a continuous response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> between two groups, denoted 1 and 2. Suppose now that we fit a simple linear regression model for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, with a dummy variable for group 2 as the only explanatory variable. This gives exactly the same results as the two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-tests and confidence intervals (under the assumption of equal variances in the groups) in Section <a href="#s-means-inference"><strong>??</strong></a>. Related to the notation of that section, the coefficients from the model are <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\alpha}=\bar{Y}_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}=\bar{Y}_{2}-\bar{Y}_{1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}\)</span> from (\ref{eq:sigma-linreg}) is equal to (\ref{eq:sehatjoint}). Similarly, the standard error (\ref{eq:sebeta}) is the same as <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\Delta}}\)</span> in (\ref{eq:seD2}), and the test statistic (\ref{eq:tbeta}) and confidence interval (\ref{eq:cibeta}) are identical with (\ref{eq:ztestmuDb}) and the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distribution version of (\ref{eq:ciDmu2}) respectively.</p>
<p>The connection between linear regression and the two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test is an illustration of how statistical methods are not a series of separate tricks for different situations, but a set of connected procedures unified by common principles. Whenever possible, methods for more complex problems have been created by extending those for simpler ones, and simple analyses are in turn special cases of more general ones. Although these connections are unfortunately often somewhat obscured by changes in language and notation, trying to understand them is very useful for effective learning of statistics.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> A second example</h3>
<p>Because the analysis of the models for infant mortality was presented piecemeal to accompany the introduction of different elements of linear regression, an overall picture of that example may have been difficult to discern. This section describes a different analysis in a more concise manner. It is particularly an illustration of the use of dummy variables, as most of the explanatory variables are categorical. The example concerns the relationship between minimum wage and employment, and uses data originally collected and analysed by David Card and Alan Krueger.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Most of the choices of analyses and variables considered here are based on those of Card and Krueger. Their article should be consulted for discussion and more detailed analyses.</p>
<p>A minimum wage of $5.05 per hour came into effect in the U.S. state of New Jersey on April 1 1992. This represented an increase from the previous, federally mandated minimum wage of $4.25 per hour. Conventional economic theory predicts that employers will react to such an increase by cutting their work force. Here the research hypothesis is thus that employment will be reduced among businesses affected by the new minimum wage. This can be addressed using suitable data, examining a statistical hypothesis of no association between measures of minimum wage increase and change of employment, controlling for other relevant explanatory variables.</p>
<p>Card and Krueger collected data for 410 fast food restaurants at two times, about one month before and eight months after the mininum wage increase came into effect in New Jersey. Only the 368 restaurants with known values of all the variables used in the analyses are included here. Of them, 268 were in New Jersey and had starting wages below $5.05 at the time of the first interview, so that these had to be increased to meet the new minimum wage. The remaining 100 restaurants provide a control group which was not affected by the change: 75 of them were in neighbouring eastern Pennsylvania where the minimum wage remained at $4.25, and 25 were in New Jersey but had starting wages of at least $5.05 even before the increase. The theoretical prediction is that the control group should experience a smaller negative employment change than the restaurants affected by the wage increase, i.e. employment in the control restaurants should not decrease or at least decrease less than in the affected restaurants. Card and Krueger argue that fast food restaurants provide a good population for examining the research question, because they employ many low-wage workers, generally comply with minimum wage legislation, do not receive tips which would complicate wage calculations, and are relatively easy to sample and interview.</p>
<p>The response variable considered here is the change between the two interviews in full-time equivalent employment at the restaurant, defined as the number of full-time workers (including managers) plus half the number of part-time workers. This will be called “Employment change” below. We consider two variables which indicate how the restaurant was affected by the minimum wage increase. The first is simply a dummy variable which is 1 for those New Jersey restaurants where wages needed to be raised because of the increase, and 0 for the other restaurants. These will be referred to as “Affected” and “Unaffected” restaurants respectively. The second variable is also 0 for the unaffected restaurants; for the affected ones, it is the proportion by which their previous starting wage had to be increased to meet the new minimum wage. For example, if the previous starting wage was the old minimum of $4.25, this “Wage gap” is <span class="math inline">\((5.05-4.25)/4.25=0.188\)</span>. Finally, we will also use information on the chain the restaurant belongs to (Burger King, Roy Rogers, Wendy’s or KFC) and whether it is owned by the parent company or the franchisee. These will be included in the analyses as partial control for other factors affecting the labour market, which might have had a differential impact on different types of restaurants over the study period. Summary statistics for the variables are shown in Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-fastfood-descr">3.3</a>.</p>

<p>: (#tab:t-fastfood-models) Response variable: Change in Full-time equivalent employment. Two fitted models for Employment change given exposure to minimum wage increase and control variables. See the text for further details.</p>
<p>Table <a href="#tab:t-fastfood-models">3.4</a> shows results for two linear regression models for Employment change, one using the dummy for affected restaurants and one using Wage gap as an explanatory variable. Both include the same dummy variables for ownership and chain of the restaurant. Consider first the model in column (1), which includes the dummy variable for affected restaurants. The estimated coefficient of this is 3.56, which is statistically significant (with <span class="math inline">\(t=3.50\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P=0.001\)</span>). This means that the estimated expected Employment change for the restaurants affected by the minimum wage increase was 3.56 full-time equivalent employees larger (in the positive direction) than for unaffected restaurants, controlling for the chain and type of ownership of the restaurant. This is the opposite of the theoretical prediction that the difference would be negative, due to the minimum wage increase leading to reductions of work force among affected restaurants but little change for the unaffected ones. In fact, the summary statistics in Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-fastfood-descr">3.3</a> show (although without controlling for chain and ownership) that average employment actually <em>increased</em> in absolute terms among the affected restaurants, but decreased among the unaffected ones.</p>
<p>The coefficients of the control variables in Table <a href="#tab:t-fastfood-models">3.4</a> describe estimated differences between company-owned and franchisee-owned restaurants, and between Burger Kings and restaurants of other chains, controlling for the other variables in the model. All of these coefficients have high <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-values for both models, suggesting that the differences are small. In fact, the only one which is borderline significant, after all the other control dummies are successively removed from the model (not shown here), is that Employment change seems to have been more negative for Roy Rogers restaurants than for the rest. This side issue is not investigated in detail here. In any case, the control variables have little influence on the effect of the variable of main interest: if all the control dummies are removed from Model (1), the coefficient of the dummy variable for affected restaurants becomes 3.61 with a standard error of 1.01, little changed from the estimates in Table <a href="#tab:t-fastfood-models">3.4</a>. This is not entirely surprising, as the control variables are weakly associated with the variable of interest: as seen in Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-fastfood-descr">3.3</a>, the proportions of affected restaurants are mostly fairly similar among restaurants of all chains and types of ownership.</p>
<p>In their article, Card and Krueger carefully explore (and confirm) the robustness of their findings by considering a series of variants of the analysis, with different choices of variables and sets of observations. This is done to try to rule out the possibility that the main conclusions are reliant on, and possibly biased by, some specific features of the data and variables in the initial analysis, such as missing data or measurement error. Such sensitivity analyses would be desirable in most social science contexts, where single definitely best form of analysis is rarely obvious. Here we will carry out a modest version of such an assessment by considering the Wage gap variable as an alternative measure of the impact of minimum wage increase, instead of a dummy for affected restaurants. This is a continuous variable, but one whose values are 0 for all unaffected restaurants and vary only among the affected ones. The logic of using Wage gap as an explanatory variable here is that Employment change could be expected to depend not only on <em>whether</em> a restaurant had to increase its starting wage to meet the new minimum wage, but also on <em>how large</em> that compulsory increase was.</p>
<p>The results for the second analysis are shown as Model (2) in Table <a href="#tab:t-fastfood-models">3.4</a>. The results are qualitatively the same as for Model (1), in that the coefficients of the control dummies are not significant, and that of Wage gap (which is 15.88) is significant and positive. The estimated employment change is thus again larger for affected than for unaffected restaurants, and their difference now even increases when the wage rise required from an affected restaurant increases. To compare these results more directly to Model (1), we can consider a comparison between an unaffected restaurant (with Wage gap 0) and an affected one with Wage gap equal to its mean among the affected restaurants, which is 0.115 (c.f. Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-fastfood-descr">3.3</a>). The estimated difference in Employment change between them, controlling for ownership and chain, is <span class="math inline">\(0.115\times 15.88=1.83\)</span>, which is somewhat lower than the 3.56 estimated from model (1).</p>
<p>This example is also a good illustration of the limitations of the <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> statistic. The <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> values of 0.046 and 0.032 are very small, so over 95% of the observed variation in employment changes remains unexplained by the variation in the three explanatory variables. In other words, there are large differences in Employment change experienced even by affected or unaffected restaurants of the same chain and type of ownership. This would make <em>predicting</em> the employment change for a particular restaurant a fairly hopeless task with these explanatory variables. However, prediction is not the point here. The research question focuses on possible differences in <em>average</em> changes in employment, and finding such differences is of interest even if variation around the averages is large.</p>
<p>In summary, the analysis provides no support for the theoretical prediction that the restaurants affected by a minimum wage increase would experience a larger negative job change than control restaurants. In fact, there was a small but significant difference in the opposite direction in both models described here, and in all of the analyses considered by Card and Krueger. The authors propose a number of tentative explanations for this finding, but do not present any of them as definitive.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Other issues in linear regression modelling</h2>
<p>The material in this chapter provides a reasonably self-contained introduction to linear regression models. However, it is not possible for a course like this to cover comprehensively all aspects of the models, so some topics have been described rather superficially and several have been omitted altogether. In this section we briefly discuss some of them. First, three previously unexplained small items in standard SPSS output are described. Second, a list of further topics in linear regression is given.</p>
<p>An example of SPSS output for linear regression models was given in Figure <a href="#fig:f-spss-linreg"><strong>??</strong></a>. Most parts of it have been explained above, but three have not been mentioned. These can be safely ignored, because each is of minor importance in most analyses. However, it is worth giving a brief explanation so as not to leave these three as mysteries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Adjusted R Square” in the “<strong>Model Summary</strong>” table is a statistic defined as <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}_{adj}=[(n-1)R^{2}-k]/(n-k-1)\)</span>. This is most relevant in situations where the main purpose of the model is prediction of future observations of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. The population value of the <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> statistic is then a key criterion of model selection. <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}_{adj}\)</span> is a better estimate of it than standard <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span>. Unlike <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}_{adj}\)</span> does not always increase when new explanatory variables are added to the model. As a sample statistic, <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}_{adj}\)</span> does not have the same interpretation as the proportion of variation of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> explained as standard <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The last two columns of the “<strong>ANOVA</strong>” (Analysis of Variance) table show the test statistic and <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value for the so-called <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. The null hypothesis for this is that the regression coefficients of <em>all</em> the explanatory variables are zero, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{1}=\beta_{2}=\dots=\beta_{k}=0\)</span>. In the case of simple regression (<span class="math inline">\(k=1\)</span>), this is equivalent to the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test for <span class="math inline">\(\beta=0\)</span>. In multiple regression, it implies that none of the explanatory variables have an effect on the response variable. In practice, this is rejected in most applications. Rejecting the hypothesis implies that at least one of the explanatory variables is associated with the response, but the test provides no help for identifying <em>which</em> of the individual partial effects are significant. The <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test is thus usually largely irrelevant. More useful is an extended version of it (which is not included in the default output), which is used for hypotheses that a set of several regression coefficients (but not all of them) is zero. For example, this could be used in the example of Table <a href="c-samples.html#tab:t-imr-m3">3.2</a> to test if income level had no effect on IMR, i.e. if the coefficients of the dummies for <em>both</em> middle and high income were zero.</p></li>
<li><p>The “Standardized Coefficients/Beta” in the “<strong>Coefficients</strong>” table are defined as <span class="math inline">\((s_{xj}/s_{y})\hat{\beta}_{j}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_{j}\)</span> is the estimated coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(s_{xj}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_{y}\)</span> are sample standard deviations of <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> respectively. This is equal to the correlation of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span> is the only explanatory variable in the model, but not otherwise. The standardized coefficient describes the expected change in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in units of its sample standard error, when <span class="math inline">\(X_{j}\)</span> is increased by one standard error <span class="math inline">\(s_{xj}\)</span>, holding other explanatory variables constant. The aim of this exercise is to obtain coefficients which are more directly comparable between different explanatory variables. Ultimately it refers to the question of <strong>relative importance</strong> of the explanatory variables, i.e. “Which of the explanatory variables in the model is the most important?” This is understandably of interest in many cases, often perhaps more so than any other aspect of the model. Unfortunately, however, relative importance is also one of the hardest questions in modelling, and one without a purely statistical solution. Despite their appealing title, standardized coefficients have problems of their own and do not provide a simple tool for judging relative importance. For example, their values depend not only on the strength of association described by <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_{j}\)</span> but also on the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(s_{xj}\)</span>, which can be different in different samples.</p>
<p>Sensible comparisons of the magnitudes of expected changes in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in response to changes in individual explanatory variables can usually be presented even without reference to standardized coefficients, simply by using the usual coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_{j}\)</span> and carefully considering the effects of suitably chosen increments of the explanatory variables. In general, it is also worth bearing in mind that questions of relative importance are often conceptually troublesome, for example between explanatory variables with very different practical implications. For instance, suppose that we have fitted a model for a measure of the health status of a person, given the amount of physical exercise the person takes (which can be changed by him/herself), investment in preventive healthcare in the area where the person lives (which can be changed, but with more effort and not by the individual) and the person’s age (which cannot be manipulated at all). The values of the unstandardized or standardized coefficients of these explanatory variables can certainly be compared, but it is not clear what statements about the relative sizes of the effects of “increasing” them would really mean.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A further course on linear regression (e.g. first half of MY452) will typically examine the topics covered on this course in more detail, and then go on to discuss further issues. Here we will give just a list of some such topics, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Model <strong>diagnostics</strong> to examine whether a particular model appears to be adequate for the data. The residuals <span class="math inline">\(Y_{i}-\hat{Y}_{i}\)</span> are a key tool in this, and the most important graphical diagnostic is simply a scatterplot of the residuals against the fitted values <span class="math inline">\(\hat{Y}_{i}\)</span>. One task of diagnostics is to identify individual <strong>outliers</strong> and <strong>influential observations</strong> which have a substantial impact on the fitted model.</p></li>
<li><p>Modelling <strong>nonlinear effects</strong> of the explanatory variables. This is mostly done simply by including transformed values like squares <span class="math inline">\(X^{2}\)</span> or logarithms <span class="math inline">\(\log(X)\)</span> as explanatory variables in the model. It is sometimes also useful to transform the response variable, e.g. using <span class="math inline">\(\log(Y)\)</span> as the response instead of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Including <strong>interactions</strong> between explanatory variables in the model. This is achieved simply by including products of them as explanatory variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying and dealing with problems caused by extremely high correlations between the explanatory variables, known as problems of <strong>multicollinearity</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model selection</strong> to identify the best sets of explanatory variables to be used in the model. This may employ both significance tests and other approaches.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis of Variance (<strong>ANOVA</strong>) and Analysis of Covariance (<strong>ANCOVA</strong>), which are terms used for models involving only or mostly categorical explanatory variables, particularly in the context of randomized experiments. Many of these models can be fitted as standard linear regression models with appropriate use of dummy variables, but the conventional terminology and notation for ANOVA and ANCOVA are somewhat different from the ones used here.</p></li>
