#### Course Description {-}

This course is intended for those with little or no past training in
quantitative methods. The course is an intensive introduction to some of
the principles and methods of statistical analysis in social research.
Topics covered in MY451 include descriptive statistics, basic ideas of
inference and estimation, contingency tables and an introduction to
linear regression models. For those with some quantitative training the
slightly more advanced course MY452 (Applied Regression Analysis) would
be more appropriate, followed by other Department of Methodology and
Department of Statistics courses on quantitative methods, such as MY454
(Applied Statistical Computing), MY455 (Multivariate Analysis and
Measurement), MY456 (Survey Methodology), MY457 (Causal Inference for
Observational and Experimental Studies), MY459 (Quantitative Text
Analysis), ST416 (Multilevel Modelling), and ST442 (Longitudinal Data
Analysis).

Please note that up to 2010-11 the course was called MI451, so older
materials will bear that code. For example, you will find past
examination papers on the Library website under MI451.

#### Course Objectives {-}

This course aims to impart a level of familiarity suitable for a
moderately critical understanding of the statistical material in the
journals commonly used by students in their work and the ability to use
some elementary techniques.

#### Staff {-}

-   **Teachers responsible**: Eleanor Power (MT) & Jonathan Jackson (LT)

-   **Course Administrator**: Esther Heyhoe, email `e.heyhoe@lse.ac.uk`

-   **Class Teachers**: MT: Tamara Shengelia & Vikas Chandra

\newpage

#### Teaching {-}

-   **Lectures**: Ten two-hour lectures in weeks 1 - 5 and 7 - 11:

    -   Michaelmas Term (MY451M): Thu 2.00pm - 4.00pm in the Tower 1 Lecture Theatre

    -   Lent Term (MY451L): Wed 2.00pm - 4.00pm in the Hong Kong
        Theatre (CLM.G.02)

-   **Computer classes**: Each student will attend a one-hour class each
    week, **starting in Week 2**. Please see on-line timetables for the
    times and places of the class groups. The allocation of students to
    classes is done through LSE for You or the Moodle system (see
    below), depending on your status. This will be exaplained in the
    first lecture and on the MY451 Moodle page. Please do not change the
    classes allocated to you without our consent.

#### Course Materials {-}

-   **Coursepack**: This coursepack is the main course text. Printed
    copies of this coursepack will be available for purchase at the
    beginning of each term, and instructions on how to obtain a hard
    copy will be given at the first lecture and on the MY451 Moodle
    page. Digital copies of this coursepack are available for download
    for free from the Moodle page.

-   **Lecture slides**: Copies of most of the slides displayed during
    the lectures can be downloaded from the MY451 Moodle page.

-   **Recommended course texts**:

    -   Alan Agresti and Christine Franklin (2013). *Statistics: The Art
        and Science of Learning from Data* (Third Ed.). Pearson.

    -   Alan Agresti and Barbara Finlay (2013). *Statistical Methods for
        the Social Sciences* (Fourth Ed.). Pearson

    Earlier editions are also suitable. While neither of these books is
    absolutely required, we recommend that you purchase one if you would
    like to have additional explanation, examples and exercises to
    supplement the coursepack. Of these two, Agresti and Finlay is a
    bit more advanced. It is also the recommended additional course text
    for MY452 (which also has a coursepack similar to this one), so you
    may want to purchase it if you are planning to also take
    that course.

-   **Other text books**: There are hundreds of introductory textbooks
    on statistics and quantitative methods, many of them covering almost
    identical material. If you have one which you would like to use, and
    which looks as if it covers the same material at about the same
    level as this course, then it is probably suitable as
    additional reading. If in doubt, please ask one of the lecturers.

    -   There are also many books which focus on the SPSS statistical
        software package used in the computer classes. We do not
        consider them necessary for this course, or for learning
        statistics or SPSS. If, however, you feel otherwise, some such
        books are mentioned in the Appendix.

#### Homework {-}

There will be homework assignments each week. These are your opportunity
to practice interpreting the results of the types of analyses that are
introduced in the lectures and then carried out in the computer classes.
The homework questions are also broadly similar in style to typical
examination questions for MY451. The questions are based on results of
the computer class exercises or of further similar analyses. For the
homework, you can use output that you produced yourself in the class or
afterwards. Alternatively, all the computer outputs that are required to
answer the homework questions can be downloaded from the Moodle page.

Homework should be submitted by Monday after its distribution in class,
at the latest by 5pm in MT and by 10am in LT. Please see the MY451
Moodle page for instructions on how to submit your homeworks. Homework
submitted in time will be corrected and returned at the next class.
Please make sure to clearly indicate your name, and the time, class
number and class teacher of your computer class on all homework
assignments. For the homework assignments, students are encouraged to
work together.

#### MY451 on Moodle {-}
<!-- {#sss-moodle} -->

The course materials are all available on Moodle. Go to
<http://moodle.lse.ac.uk/> and login using your *username* and
*password* (the same as for your LSE e-mail). Then in the *select
courses* dialogue box type in MY451, and in *search results* click on
MY451. The site contains the structure of the course week by week, the
readings, weekly computer class assignments and the associated data
sets, coursepack and other materials, as well as a section on news and
announcements.

#### Advisory Sessions {-}

There will be a time each week during the Michaelmas and Lent terms
during which a member of the teaching team will be available at the
Department of Methodology in Columbia House to answer questions about
the course. Information on the times of the advisory hours will be given
at the first lecture. These sessions are not intended to be private
tutorials and you will be expected to have made a genuine attempt to
work through the relevant sections of the coursepack prior to coming to
an advisory session. Also, questions addressing material from that
week’s lecture will be given priority. If you are having difficulty with
a topic, come and see us at that time. If you wait until the end of
term, when the advisory sessions can be very busy, we cannot guarantee
that your questions from earlier sessions will be covered. **There will
be no advisory sessions after the end of Lent Term.**

#### Notes on studying for the course {-}

To learn the material from this course you must do the work every week
since it is cumulative; if you miss a week or two (or sleep through it!)
there is a chance that you will find yourself hopelessly lost. So this
is definitely not a “pick and choose” course! Also bear in mind that
most people cannot learn quantitative techniques passively by just
turning up to the lectures and reading the occasional chapter in a
textbook. To learn statistics you have to do it; there are no shortcuts.
Thus in addition to a two-hour weekly lecture there will be one-hour
computer classes (in which you do some data analysis and interpretation
using SPSS - instructions will be provided) and there will be weekly
homework (which will be corrected but not graded by your class teacher).
Doing the assignments in the computer classes and the homework
demonstrate whether you have understood and can apply what was covered
in the lectures. If you are having any trouble this will reveal what the
problem is. Thus the course is designed to have multiple, reinforcing
ways of helping you get to grips with this material.

#### Examinations/assessment {-}

There will be a **two-hour examination in the Summer Term 2016**. You are allowed to bring in
limited notes to the examination. You are required to bring your own calculators for the
examination. Examination papers from previous years are available for
revision purposes at the LSE library web site. Students should
understand that past examinations should only be used as rough guides to
the types of questions that are likely to appear on the examination.

For many of you, MY451 is only one part of a package of methods training
with a course code such as MC4M1 or MY4M1. If this is the case, your
result for MY451 will contribute only part of the final mark for the
package, with a weight determined by the regulations.

#### Computing {-}

Students must know their Username and Password in time for the first
class. This information can be obtained from IT Help Desk (Library, 1st
floor). The course uses Microsoft Windows-based software. If you are not
familiar with the program, you might want to attend introductory courses
in Windows during the first two weeks of the term. The statistical
package being used is SPSS, which will be introduced in the first
computing class of the course.

#### Software availability {-}

A personal copy of the program SPSS for Windows can be bought by course
participants (maximum 1 copy per person) for the price of £10 from IT
services, **not** the Department of Methodology.

#### Feedback {-}

We would welcome any comments you have on the course. If there are any
problems that we can deal with, we will attempt to do so as quickly as
possible. Speak to any member of the course team, or to your
departmental supervisor if you feel that would be easier for you. Also
please let us know if you find any errors or omissions in the
coursepack, so that we can correct them for next year.

#### Acknowledgements {-}

The computer classes were extensively revised for 2012-13. The hard work
of designing the new exercises and writing the revised instructions was
done by Sally Stares.

This coursepack bears many traces of previous materials and all of their
authors, Colm O’Muircheartaigh, Colin Mills, Matt Mulford, Fiona Steele,
Paul Mitchell, and Sally Stares. Many thanks to Farimah Daftary, Sue
Howard, Jon Jackson, Paul Mitchell, Indraneel Sircar, and many students
of previous years for comments and suggestions which are incorporated in
the current revision.

#### FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions {-}

**Why do we use SPSS? I’ve heard that SAS/STATA/MINITAB/R/LIMDEP is much
better.** At this level it does not matter which program you use since
we are learning standard procedures that are common to all programs. In
favour of SPSS is that it has an easy to learn interface and that it is
widely available at sites both within and outside the UK.

**Can I get a copy of the SPSS software to use on my home computer?**
Yes, for a small fee from IT Services helpdesk, not from the Department
of Methodology.

**I’m taking MY451 because I want to learn how to use SPSS but we don’t
seem to learn very much about the program. Why is that?** MY451 is not a
course about learning to use SPSS. We use the program merely to
facilitate data analysis and interpretation. Some options for learning
more about SPSS will be mentioned in the first lecture.

**I’m taking MY451 to help me analyse data for my dissertation. Can I
discuss my data and my specific problems with the lecturers?** Yes, but
not during the course. Staff of the Department of Methodology will be
happy to talk to you about problems specific to your dissertation during
the weekly sessions of the Methodology Surgery (see the website of the
department for more information).

**Does the coursepack contain everything I need to know for the exam?**
Yes. However, you will stand by far the best chance in the exam if you
also attend the lectures, where the lecturers emphasise and explain the
key parts of the material.

**The lecturer introduced some material that was not in the coursepack.
Do I need to know that material?** This is almost certainly an illusion.
The lectures will not introduce any genuinely new material not included
in the course pack. However, sometimes the lecturer may of course use
different words or a different example to further explain some topic.
Copies of the most relevant notes displayed at the lectures will be
posted in the MY451 Moodle site. All of the material required for the
exam is contained in the coursepack, with the posted lecture notes as
additional clarification.

**Do I need to bring my coursepack to lectures and classes?** Yes,
because some of the material displayed during the lectures will be
graphs or tables straight from the coursepack. However, an even more
important way of using the coursepack is to read the relevant parts of
it *before* each lecture. In addition, you will find the instructions
for the class exercises at the end of the coursepack.

**I can’t make it to the advisory hour. Why aren’t there more of them?**
Advisory hours are offered in addition to the normal support
arrangements for School courses and rely on the goodwill and enthusiasm
of the course team. Given that most team members also offer their time
to support advisory hours for other courses there is a limit to how much
time they can volunteer. If you genuinely are unable to attend an
advisory hour, but desperately need advice, lecturers will always see
you in their personal office hours. If these are inconvenient you may be
able to set up an appointment at another time by special arrangement.

\newpage

**There was a long queue at advisory and I didn’t get much/any time to
discuss my particular problem. Isn’t there a better way to arrange
things?** Advisory sessions are meant for quick feedback and
clarification of problems on a first-come first served basis. They are
not meant to be personal tutorials, seminars or impromptu lectures. They
are also not meant to be a substitute for attending the lectures;
reading the course-pack; doing the homework; thinking. Priority is
always given to problems related to the previous week’s lecture
material. If several people have the same problem it will usually be
possible to talk to everyone together, but there is a finite limit to
how many people can be crammed into an office at the same time!

**I want to bring my homework to the advisory session because I couldn’t
understand the class teacher’s comments. Is that OK?** Yes, but it is
unlikely that the person that wrote the comments on your homework will
be taking the advisory hour. Usually it will be much better to discuss
homework comments directly with your class teacher in class.

**Can I work together on the homework with my friends?** Yes, we
positively encourage you to discuss the homework assignments with your
colleagues. If you do this, please submit **one** copy to be marked
rather than multiple copies of the same answers.

**If I get less than 50% in the exam what happens now?** Candidates sit
MY451 under different examination regulations depending on which
department they are in and what degree they are registered for. For some
degrees a pass in MY451 is required, for others the mark from MY451 is
just one component of an overall course mark (implying a “pass” mark in
MY451 is not required). The regulations for your degree are not set by
Methodology, but by your home department. To find out whether a pass in
MY451 is required, consult your degree regulations or ask the tutor
responsible for your program in your home department. Candidates who
fail at the first attempt and whose degree regulations require a pass
are, as per the usual School examination rules, entitled, at the next
available opportunity, to ONE more attempt. This will be in the Summer
Term of the next Session.

**Why don’t we get our examination scripts returned after they have been
marked?** Written work is of two sorts, formative and summative. The
former, for example the homework exercises, is meant to give you
feedback on how you are doing and will, where appropriate, be returned
with comments. The latter, for example the examination, is meant to
evaluate your performance, not explain to you where you have gone wrong,
or for that matter where you have done exceptionally well.

**If I don’t agree with the mark, how do I appeal?** The cultural norm
in the UK is that marks are not arrived at by a process of
teacher-student negotiation. You can make a formal appeal through the
School’s appeal process (see the appropriate section of the website for
details). NB: appeals cannot be made on grounds of academic substance,
only on grounds of procedural irregularities. In other words an appeal
will not be allowed if the only grounds you have for appealing is that
you/your friend/your personal advisor/your spiritual guru think your
script was worth more marks than the examiners did.

**The class teachers are always very busy during class helping people
with problems and I can’t get enough personal attention. Why can’t there
be more class teachers in the classroom?** For MY451 there will usually
be two class teachers per classroom i.e. double the normal complement.
Even so we realise that you may not be able to get attention at the
exact moment you want it. Please be patient and if help is not
immediately available you can always try asking the person who is
sitting next to you!

**I’m not registered at the LSE but at another University of London
college. Can I attend this course?** Normally yes, but you will have to
complete an intercollegiate enrolment form.

**I would like to audit the course without taking the exam. Is that
OK?** Yes, you are welcome to attend the lectures providing you are an
LSE/University of London student and there is room for you.

**MY451 is not challenging enough for me. Is there a more difficult
course?** Yes, MY452 and numerous other courses offered by the
Department of Methodology and the Statistics department.
